# WordShuffle2
26/01/2023
Part 2 of programming Word Shuffle, now coded in JavaScript.

Shuffle.html - coded with help from ChatGPT.  Using Prompt made the shuffle not work properly, this was because the While loop was blocking the HTML renderer from updating.  It was rewritten (a working version) below in Shuffle2.html.
Shuffle2.html - coded with help from a Stack Overflow JavaScript coder, who solved the Prompt problem with a button and an event, minus any loop.
